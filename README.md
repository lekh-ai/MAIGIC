# MAIGIC: My AI Generates Insights and Charts üöÄ
MAIGIC is a `Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG)` based AI-powered tool designed to generate insightful analyses and visualizations from user's submitted CSV file. The project uses `Langchain LLM` and  `llama-3-70b-instruct` to interpret datasets and create meaningful charts that help users understand underlying patterns and trends.

[![Deploy in Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Hugging%20Face-ffd500?style=for-the-badge&logo=huggingface&logoColor=white)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lekhsisodiya/Magic)

For deploying in local server(flask version) pull the entire repository and run app.py.
 - LLM API creds would be made available on request

## Features ‚ú®
- **Data Insights**: Takes user input data as a CSV file and requested query returns responses from a `llama-3-70b-instruct` hosted on IBM cloud using `IBM WatsonX` framework.
- **Chart Generation**: Internally utilises python's seaborm(matplotlib) and creates visualizations on the submitted data such as bar charts, line graphs, and more, creativity beyond limits.
- **User Interface**: Provides a visually appelaing & easy-to-use web interface for interaction.
- **Pandas dataframe agent**: Utilizes Pandas dataframe agent models to predict and analyze data.

## Deployments üåê

There are two deployments of this project across two Python frameworks:

### Flask Version
- Runs on a local server
- Supports robust designs and functionality using HTML, CSS, and JS
- Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/lekh-ai/RAG.git```

### Streamlit Version
- Deployed on Hugging Face
- [Streamlit Deployment Link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lekhsisodiya/Magic)

Both versions have different UI and frontend configurations. Unlike Streamlit/Gradio, Flask supports HTML, CSS, and JS for more robust designs and functionality.

### Future Development üöÄ
Ticketing System: Facilitate recording and tracking of issues and grant the LLM access to this data to generate insights.
Roles and Permissions: Allot admin and user roles so only admins can create insights from the ticketing database using credentials.
